               <p><b>Course Description:</b>
                  I would not recommend this class. The course description was very misleading, and the course load was very heavy. For example, every week, I had over 200 pages to read from the textbook. Also, the professor was quite rude in the way he spoke to students and never answered his emails.

                  ADM 3360, Business Law was an interesting class. At first, I thought it was very demanding and required a lot of studying, however throughout the semester I released it was manageable. There was 1 midterm, and 2 essays regarding the evolution of business law. I finished the course with an A -.
